# car_sharing
This is data analysis of a car_sharing dataset
This project involves preprocessing and storage of the data using SQLite3
The project also involves the use of some machine Learning models such as ARIMA model. It further went with the usage of random forest regressor and a deep neural network to predict the demand rate and report the minimum square error for each model
